# Dotfiles

Some config files I've built up for vim(/nvim) and tmux. 

`.tmux.conf` started from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/3cn5gi/tmux_is_my_wm_on_os_x/) and [here](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-guide-to-customizing-your-tmux-conf/), and I've customized it slightly.

`.vimrc` started from some unknown sources, and I've changed it signifciantly. Several snippets are taken from the vim wiki
and helpful stackoverflow answers. 

The `darcula.vim` color theme is from [here](https://github.com/blueshirts/darcula), I think.
